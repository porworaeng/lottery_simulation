# Monte Carlo Simulation of Thailand's Government Lottery üé≤üéüÔ∏è

## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the outcomes of purchasing Thailand's government lottery tickets. The purpose is to analyze the probabilities of winning and understand the real value of a lottery ticket based on the odds of different prizes.

The goal is to provide insights into lottery ticket value, explore the statistical chances of winning, and demonstrate how simulation can help in understanding these probabilities.

## Features
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulates thousands or millions of lottery draws to estimate the probability of winning different prizes.
- **Prize List and Odds Calculation**: Incorporates actual prize levels and their corresponding odds from the Thailand government lottery.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes the simulation results with key metrics like mean, median, variance, and more.
- **Visualizations**: Provides visual representations of the simulation results, including normal distribution curves and other insights.

## How It Works
1. **Define Lottery Structure**: Inputs the prize structure and corresponding odds for each prize in the Thailand government lottery.
2. **Run Simulation**: Uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate repeated ticket purchases and calculate win probabilities.
3. **Analyze Results**: Generates descriptive statistics and visualizes the distribution of wins and losses based on the simulated data.
   
## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` (or another visualization library)
  - `scipy`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/porworaeng/lottery_simulation.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
